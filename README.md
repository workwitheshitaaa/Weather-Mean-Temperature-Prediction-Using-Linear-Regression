# Weather-Mean-Temperature-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This project uses Linear Regression to predict daily mean temperature from features like max temp, min temp, wind speed, and precipitation. The dataset is cleaned, analyzed, split into train/test sets, and the model’s accuracy is evaluated using R² and MSE metrics.
